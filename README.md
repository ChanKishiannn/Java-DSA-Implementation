# 📚 Java-DSA-Implementation – From Scratch

Welcome to my personal collection of **Java Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** projects!  
This repository serves as a coding journal where I build DSA solutions **from scratch** to better understand how algorithms and data structures work — and to track my progress as I continue learning Java.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

As a self-taught developer, I created this repo to:

- Reinforce my understanding of core DSA concepts
- Document my learning journey and improvements over time
- Create a resource I can revisit and improve as I grow

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Each folder contains Java DSA implementations based on:
- Machine problems I saw online
- Classic resources (books, school-style problems)
- AI-generated challenges

### ✅ Implemented Topics

- **Stack**
  - `ArrayStack` – Basic stack operations using arrays
  - `LinkedListStack` – Basic stack operations using LinkedList
- **Queue**
  - `ArrayQueue` – Basic queue operations using array
  - *(More coming soon)*
- **LinkedList**
  - `ReverseLinkedList` – ReverseLinkedList operations practice
  - *(More coming soon)*
