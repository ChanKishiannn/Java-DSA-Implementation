# ðŸ“š Java-DSA-Implementation â€“ From Scratch

Welcome to my personal collection of **Java Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** projects!  
This repository serves as a coding journal where I build DSA solutions **from scratch** to better understand how algorithms and data structures work â€” and to track my progress as I continue learning Java.

---

## ðŸš€ Purpose

As a self-taught developer, I created this repo to:

- Reinforce my understanding of core DSA concepts
- Document my learning journey and improvements over time
- Create a resource I can revisit and improve as I grow

---

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

Each folder contains Java DSA implementations based on:
- Machine problems I saw online
- Classic resources (books, school-style problems)
- AI-generated challenges
