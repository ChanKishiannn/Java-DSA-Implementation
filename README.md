# Java-DSA-Implementation – From Scratch

Welcome to my personal collection of **Java Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** projects!  
This repository serves as a coding journal where I build DSA solutions **from scratch** to better understand how algorithms and data structures work — and to track my progress as I continue learning Java.

---

## Purpose

As a self-taught developer, I created this repo to:

- Reinforce my understanding of core DSA concepts
- Document my learning journey and improvements over time
- Create a resource I can revisit and improve as I grow

---

## Topics Covered

Each folder contains Java DSA implementations based on:
- Machine problems I saw online
- Classic resources (books, school-style problems)
- AI-generated challenges

### Implemented Topics
- **Array**
  - `Static Array` – Static Array Implementation (Basic Array)
  - `Dynamic Array` – Dynamic Array Implementation (Array that grow aswell as the data grows)
- **Stack**
  - `ArrayStack` – Basic stack operations using arrays
  - `LinkedListStack` – Basic stack operations using LinkedList
- **Queue**
  - `ArrayQueue` – Basic queue operations using array
  - `LinkedQueue` – Basic queue operations using LinkedList
- **LinkedList**
  - `SinglyLinkedList` – SinglyLinkedList Implementation
  - `DoublyLinkedList` – DoublyLinkedList Implementation
  - `CircularLinkedList` – CircularLinkedList Implementation
  - `ReverseLinkedList` – ReverseLinkedList Implementation
- **Linear Search**
  - `Linear Search Implementation 1`
  - `Linear Search Implementation 2`
  - `Linear Search Implementation 3`
- **Binary Search**
  - `Binary Search Implementaion`
- **Interpolation Search**
  - `Interpolation Search Implementaion`
- **Bubble Sort**
  - `Bubble Sort Algorithm Implementaion`
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
